permalink: /about/

  I've been an iOS developer since 2012, contracted some, worked at <a href="www.goclio.com">Clio</a> and am currently inhabiting <a href="www.shopify.com">Shopify</a>.
  I'm most comfortable C-ing Objectively and coding Swiftly (I can't help myself, I'm sorry). I'm also Canadian.

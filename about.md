  I've been an iOS developer since 2012, and currently painting with the internet at <a href="https://thebrowser.company">The Browser Company</a> 🎨. 
  
  Previously, I've...
  <ul>
  <li>inhabited the mothership at 🍎,</li>
  <li> checked out some merchants at Shopify 🛒,</li> 
  <li> and definitely did not provide legal counsel at <a href="https://www.clio.com/">Clio</a> ⚖️.</li>
  </ul>
  
  I'm most comfortable meandering Swiftly and C-ing Objectively - I can't help myself, I'm sorry. I'm also Canadian 🇨🇦.

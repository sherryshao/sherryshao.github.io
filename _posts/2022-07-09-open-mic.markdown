Joined a local choir, <a href="https://www.thechorusstudio.com/">Chorus Studio</a>, recently, and have been lurking about, contributing by blending my voice in a crowd of beautiful singers. Finally worked up the courage to take a stab at one of their open mic nights!

Thanks to an mvp choir bud, a bit of evidence was recorded!

excerpt: "A memorable song for a memorable event!"
---

My dear friends Angela and Zack got married recently - and as part of the best crew, Sarah and I were tasked with remaking a song for the bride and groom's first dance! Grateful for Sarah, who was able to recreate the instrumentals effortlessly, as well as donate her brief trip in Vancouver to recording some vocals. All I had to do is record more layers of vocals and slap things together in GarageBand™!

It was fun to attempt to make harmonies sound less robotic, standing in different parts of the room singing the same thing, but maybe with slightly different enunciations, to feel like multiple people are singing the song instead of just 10X Sherrys - which is an existential nightmare.

The process took longer than expected, and sometimes I needed to step away to try to be objective with what I'm hearing again - also glad Ange and Zack were super collaborative, gave really good notes on the iterations we had, and were just the chillest people alive despite planning one of the biggest parties of their lives.

Day of, as first dance commences, watching my two friends swaying to this song, singing the lyrics to each other, being surrounded by their loved ones, just felt like such an incredible privilege to witness and be a part of 💜

And with that, here's the attempt!

excerpt: 'Did a cover of "Sunny days" by Allen Stone'

Flying to Toronto in 2 weeks for the one and only Allen Stone and some good vibes! As part of that celebration, did a cover of the song that was [submitted on Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lm6WjoXMOLw) to the contest but also wanted to add to my soundcloud collection :) 

KARAOKEEE. Thanks Garageband - sorry, weirdly edited music.

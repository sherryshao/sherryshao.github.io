excerpt: 'Masterchef, the most competitive TV show for homecooks to show off their skills to Gordon Ramsay - from the perspective of a shitty cook who eats shitty food.'

It has become an obsession of mine to watch an episode of Masterchef during dinner, where amateur chefs cook their hearts out only to be belittled by the almighty Gordon Ramsay.

The ritual is only complete with eating shit food and contagious potty mouth-ing.

excerpt: 'What to do with 14 days, 140 square feet, and no windows?'
---

Taiwan has done extemely well with their quarantine policies for incoming visitors: 2 weeks at a quarantine hotel of your own choosing (and expensing), 1 week of self-observation, then you're released into the wild barring any symptoms or positive tests. 

I've decided to travel back last minute to see some family; prior to departing, I went through the process of asking the embassy "hoW I eNTer with expIreD pAssPOrt?", digging up said expired passport, booking a last available appointment to get a pleasant nose swab, and booking my quarantine hotel.

Now, I knew I was going spend some moolahs as my time spent with family will automatically be deducted by 2 weeks, making my total trip length a little over a month. So, my criteria for a hotel room were along the lines of "does it look relatively clean?", "shower? Y/N", "wifi, juice it up, pls", etc. Once I found something that fit what I needed, I had booked it without a second thought.

A week before leaving Vancouver, it was brought to my attention that "windows? Y/N", would have been a good candidate in my checklist. I frantically looked on the quarantine hotels list and availabilities. Everything was booked up.

And that brings us to now, 3 days into my windowless existence.

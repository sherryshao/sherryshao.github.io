excerpt: 'Adventure in Peru'
---

A friend visited the magnificent Peru last year, and while all of her instagram stories were infuriatingly amazing, the backstory of her last week there was not quite up to par. Apparently her credit card company decided that this was the time to irreversibly suspend her account without informing her in advance, and she is now left with about $20 Canadian (or was it $50, I'm a bad friend) to spend on food and transportation for the remaining duration of her solo adventures. After resourcefully surviving the week on light meals and mostly pure will, she is left with exactly $1 to make her way to the airport. 

For some reason, even after she told me that it was a proper bus she had taken, as soon as she mentioned the presence of numerous clucking chickens onboard, and the fact that she had to yell 'POR FAVOR' to gather the attention of the bus driver to let her off at absolutely no designated spots, the following is what I'd like to imagine really happened:

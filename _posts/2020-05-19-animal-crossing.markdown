excerpt: 'A new addiction - left with more questions than answers'

In times of quarantine, comes Animal Crossing: New Horizons - a reimagined classic game, serving as our escape to reform a deserted island, owe pretend-debt to a potential crook, and as a result, catch and sell lots of lots of fish and bugs.

I am quite addicted to the game, and I admire all the little details Nintendo has put into it. The one thing I cannot seem to get over, though, is the fact that I could shove a megaton of bugs, fish and objects I can collect from the game, somehow still waddle my way into Nook's Cranny like it's no big deal, and sell everything within a second. 

Below is sort of how I imagine that process would go down:

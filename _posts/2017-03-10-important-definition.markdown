<p><em>noun</em></p>

A sound often produced to either express 1. happiness and some form of celebration, or 2. the I-have-no-more-fucks-left-to-give sentiment. In case 1., instead of nodding in agreement, fellow developers may choose to respond with further calls of "hululu..." as acknowledgement of similar sentiments. In case 2., the sound coupled with the action of sprinting away as fast as one can manage is recommended for full effect.

<p>
A scenario for case 1 would be:<br/><br/>
<em>
Pavel: "Hey Sherry, hululululululu"<br/>
Sherry: "Hululululululu!"<br/>
</em>
</p>
<br/><br/>
<p>
A scenario for case 2 woule be:<br/><br/>
<em>
Jason: "Hey Reilly, I found this bug on your bran-"<br/>
Reilly: "HULULULULULULU" - whilst running the other direction.<br/>
</em>
</p>

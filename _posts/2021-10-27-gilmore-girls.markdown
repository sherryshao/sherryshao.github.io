excerpt: 'Gilmore Girls and the la-la songs'

One other thing about quarantining is that I can binge all the shows I want. The only thing is, my obsessive personality already binged all the new shows I've been wanting to watch - naturally, I needed to go back to a classic.

Enter, Gilmore Girls.

Yes, we're aware the Lorelai's of the show have very privileged problems as pointed out by numerous blogs and articles written a decade after the original show aired - but I can't help it, I adore the mother and daughter relationships in this show, I love the small town "vibes", and Luke's is a staple (can you tell I'm still in the early seasons of my rewatch?)

Anywho, it seemed like I had some time on my hands, so I recorded a snippet of my favourite "lala" songs that is replayed throughout the show:

excerpt: 'The ideal vacation: beaches, soft sand, nonstop swirling between waves, beautiful people running in slow motion.'

We just got back from an amazing vacation in Bermuda - the sand is pink, the air is warm, and the waves are endless. Our entire photo album from the trip looked flawless, we glistened under the Bermudian sun and I could almost hear our laughter emitting from the photos. That is, until I discovered our GoPro footage and was quickly reminded of what really went down in Bermuda.

It's been a long time coming, our trip to Iceland. I loved it so much that I made a little <a href="https://arc.net/e/6BD85E36-C6C0-4E96-8201-D4052C985A14">easel</a> to document the highlights of the trip.

Since the easel provides photo evidence, here's the TL;DR:

<ul>
<li>☔ so. much. rain.</li>
<li>🌈 prime time waterfalls. they're all in iceland</li>
<li>🌋 nothing active, but mucho craters</li>
<li>🛁 blue lagoon is tiktok heaven 🙅‍♀️</li>
<li>💍 proposed at significant waterfall! (he said yes)</li>
<li>🚐 double proposal in camper van! (I also said yes)</li>
<li>⛵ husavik was a hoot; jaja dingdong was not</li>
<li>🍿 AURORA BOREALIS 💚</li>
</ul>

...and we pretty much peaked at northern lights - but the rest of the trip was still pretty fun (thankfully only 2 more days to go after that)

Before leaving the land of the (n)ice, our car rental company, <a href="https://www.kukucampers.is/reviews">Kuku Campers</a>, is holding a <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CdoVJHIAB6Z/">60-second video contest</a> for all of their rentals this year. Since I invested so much time squatting down awkwardly for the perfect 10-second video in many, very public, locations we visited - I thought we might throw our hats in the ring to see if it comes of anything!
